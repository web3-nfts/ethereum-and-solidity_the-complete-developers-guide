#   38. Syntax Highlighters
Links to syntax highlighters are below.  Remember that syntax highlighting for Solidity code isn't strictly required, and we won't be writing a lot of Solidity inside our editor.  With that in mind, if you run into any installation issues I'd recommend continuing on rather than trying to troubleshoot it.

-   Atom - https://atom.io/packages/language-ethereum
    -   Open the package installation manager in atom and search for 'language-ethereum'.  After installing the package, you might have to manually change the highlighter in the .sol file.  Look for the selector at the bottom right of your editor window.
-   Sublime - https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ethereum
