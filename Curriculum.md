# Curriculum

In our course, you’ll learn blockchain, smart contracts, NFTs, and more so you finish with the qualifications to **land a Web3 job**—and the portfolio to prove it. 

We worked with industry experts to build our new Web3 Development course, based on the skills and tech stack most commonly needed for Web3 developers and related positions. With our course, you’ll learn Web3 through on-demand instruction, live events with experts, and hands-on projects on your schedule. You will have access to this flexible course for one year, and it is designed so you can **upskill while working full-time**, in as few as 10 weeks.

“This course was developed by people from a wide range of professional experience and, as a result, has everything for people who are just starting with Web3 and those who know a little bit but want to learn more.”

Graduates of the new BloomTech Web3 Development course will gain the skills and tooling experience necessary to build production decentralized apps (dapps). The program explores current trends in Web3 development including NFTs, DeFi, and cryptography.

In the course, you will learn Web3 best practices for writing and testing smart contracts in Solidity, an extremely popular contract programming language. You will learn how to test and protect your smart contracts. This is an exceptionally in-demand skill, considering vulnerabilities have caused companies to lose millions of dollars in attacks.

The Web3 course will cover deployment to both Polygon and Ethereum mainnet. Please note: Several coding practice exercises and projects require using test coins to complete transactions. We will never ask you to use real coins in this course.
